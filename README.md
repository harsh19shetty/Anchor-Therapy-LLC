# Anchor-Therapy-LLC
Anchor Therapy is a mental health counseling center in downtown Hoboken, NJ operated by two therapists. Their mission is to help you, or your teen, feel relief from whatever stress oneâ€™s dealing with. Our focus is on devising the right marketing strategy for Anchor Therapy to deliver optimal solutions to maximize public interest that translates into increasing her client base. The approach we took was to enrich UX by developing a Chatbot for their website and target the right audience by understanding their Twitter posts.
